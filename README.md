## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This app uses HTML, raw CSS and Javascript. This was my first app that i really got to explore how to use an API and it was really exciting to make. The most difficult part was going through all the API data and trying to figure out what and how to use it.

## Optimizations

I want to go back and clean up the CSS and fix some responsive issues.

## Lessons Learned:

This app is my first time really diving into using APIs. I learned a lot about how in depth some of these APIs can be. I also found it exciting trying to figure out how to manipulate these API's and make the best use of them. I learned to read how to use the API first because they all can be a little different. You'll understand a lot more and be able to manipulate the data easier.
